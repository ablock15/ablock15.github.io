                <br /><br />Hey!
                <br /><br />My name is Avram Block, but I go by Avi. My pronouns are He/Him/His.
                <br />I am currently a Junior at Tufts University, with a double major in Cognitive and Brain Sciences and Computer Science.
                <br /><br />Academically, my interests lie at the intersection of these two fields.
                <br />I wish to develop products which expand the possibilities of humans working closer with computers and computers behaving more like people in order to facilitate this. Whether this is through programming, Human-Computer Interaction research, Human-Robotic Interaction research, or simply through experimental psychology research on the ways humans approach problems, I am willing and eager to explore any avenue towards this goal.
                <br /><br />Outside of my academic interests, I am also involved in many things on and off campus in my life.
                <br />I am the Music Director for WMFO, Tuftsâ€™ radio station. I am also a staff leader for Tufts Wilderness Orientation, a pre-orientation program for incoming students. I play bass guitar, and enjoy practicing and improving at artistic skills like graphic design and fashion design.
